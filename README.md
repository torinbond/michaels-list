# Michael's List

Michael's List is a simple [craigslist](http://www.craigslist.com) 
search aggregator that makes use of [YQL](http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/) for fetching 
data, [AJAX](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/) for making calls and populating the page, and 
[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) for UI elements.   

This is a small side project I'll be hosting here. I got the idea from a web engineering class, 
when we were discussing about how widely used craigslist is, despite how horrendusly dated their
website's interface is. When I found out all of their data is accessible through YQL, this idea
came a long. So feel free to contribute or submit features you would like to see.
