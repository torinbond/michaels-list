# Michael's List

Michael's List is a simple [craigslist](http://www.craigslist.com) 
search aggregator that makes use of [YQL](http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/) for fetching 
data, [AJAX](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/) for making calls and populating the page, and 
[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) for UI elements.   

This project is the product of many years of iterative development and combined
community knowledge. It does not impose a specific development philosophy or
framework, so you're free to architect your code in the way that you want.
